# Using Myna with Node.js

Myna is registered at [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/myna-parser) as a Node.js module. 

    npm install myna-parser 

Once that is done you can run the the test script as follows:

    npm test

Which resolves to:

    node index.js

The result will be that an object representing a Myna module will be created and displayed in the console showing all of its member functions and variables.
